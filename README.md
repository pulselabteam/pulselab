# pulselab
"PulseLab'', is the first comprehensive MATLAB toolbox that covers all the necessary steps for estimating the blood pressure from raw electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, using pulse wave velocity (PWV)-based models. The toolbox includes a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) offering visualization for step-by-step processing of physiological signals (including various measures and metrics), thereby, helping to obtain the most accurate model for blood pressure estimation.
