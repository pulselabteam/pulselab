# pulselab
"PulseLab'', is the first comprehensive MATLAB toolbox that covers all the necessary steps for estimating the blood pressure from raw electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, using pulse wave velocity (PWV)-based models. The toolbox includes a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) offering visualization for step-by-step processing of physiological signals (including various measures and metrics), thereby, helping to obtain the most accurate model for blood pressure estimation.

A quick starter guide to run PulseLab after downloading and unzipping the file:

1. Launch MATLAB R2019b.

2. Locate the “PulseLab” folder

3. Add the “PulseLab” folder to path: Add to Path -> Selected Folders and Subfolders

4. Open the “PulseLab” folder in MATLAB and see “PulseLab.m” in the “Current Folder” window

5. In “Command Window”, type “PulseLab”, and the GUI should open

6. In the “File Load” panel of the GUI, the files including the data can be loaded via the “Browse” and "Load" buttons

7. Via the “Individual BP Fitting” tab on the right half of the GUI, a PAT-BP model can be chosen or a new one can be uploaded. By clicking on the “Evaluate & Plot” button, the “Regression Metrics” and plots should show up.
